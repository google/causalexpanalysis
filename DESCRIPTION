Description: Functions to perform causal and experiment analysis, i.e., analysis
  for the causal inference of both experiments and observational studies, within
  a single framework, with a unifying theme of evaluating covariate balance.
  Three kinds of samples can be created—unadjusted, weighted, and matched—and
  two kinds of estimators of treatment effects—an analysis of variance (ANOVA)
  estimator, i.e., a simple difference-in-means estimator, and an analysis of
  covariance (ANCOVA) estimator, i.e., a regression adjustment estimator, with
  either equal or unequal slopes assumption for the covariates. Contains helper
  functions for statistical inference and modeling, visualization of results,
  and data manipulation.
